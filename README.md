ProjectEuler
============

Some tinkering/solutions for Project Euler problems. The goal of this is to learn more about theories in Math and write efficient and clean algorithms to implement them.

NOTE: I do not attempt all the problems only those that look interesting or challenging to me.

If you have any ideas, suggestions, etc about my solutions feel free to contact me

Solutions are implemented using Python(mostly) and Java(some).
